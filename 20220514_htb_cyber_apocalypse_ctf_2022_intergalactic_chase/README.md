| Difficulty | medium |
| Description | The Red Island of the glowing sea is a proud tribe of species that can only see red colors. Hence every physical item, picture, and poster on this island is masked with red colors. The Golden Fang army took advantage of the color weakness of the species of Red Island to smuggle illegal goods in and out of the island behind the ministry's back. Without an invitation, it's impossible to get entry to the island. So we need to hack the ministry and send us an invite from the inside to stop the atrocities of Draeger's men on this island. As always, Ulysses, with his excellent recon skills, got us access to one of the portals of the Red Island ministry. Can you gain access to their networks through this portal? |

| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | Years have passed since Miyuki rescued you from the graveyard. When Virgil tells you that he needs your help with something he found there, desperate thoughts about your father and the disabilities you developed due to the disposal process come to mind. The device looks like an advanced GPS with AI capabilities. Riddled with questions about the past, you are pessimistic that you could be of any value. After hours of fiddling and observing the power traces of this strange device, you and Virgil manage to connect to the debugging interface and write an interpreter to control the signals. The protocol looks familiar to you. Your father always talked about implementing this scheme in devices for security reasons. Could it have been him? |

For weeks, everything went smoothly, until you ran into a meteor storm. Having little to no data of training, the AI is now malfunctioning. Ulysses freaks out because he can no longer control the spaceship due to the AI overriding his manual commands. Big banging noises terrify your crew members. Everything is shaking. It’s time to act. Do you think you can temporarily shut down “Jenny” until she becomes more sophisticated? |

Feeling defeated and ashamed to have put Miyuki, who saved you, in danger, you slowly walk back to the lab. More determined than ever to find out what’s wrong with your brain, you start poking at one of its chips. This chip is linked to a decision-making algorithm based on human intuition. It seems to be encrypted… but some errors pop up when certain user data is entered. Is there a way to extract more information and fix the chip? |

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |

| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | A day before the memorial of the Dying Sun, Miyuki began talking about Broider, a death squad commander and a friend of Paulie’s capturer. He would be a party guest at Viryr’s palace. After examining a lot of different scenarios, Miyuki came up with a plan in which Paulie would lure Broider to a secluded location so the group could capture him. Following the plan, a wild chase had just begun when the two looked each other in the eye. After an extremely risky maneuver, Paulie outwitted Broider and led him into an alley in Vinyr’s undercity. The plan was a success. Your squad had managed to capture Broider and bring him back to the ship. After hours of interrogation by Ulysses, he revealed the final key to a series of encrypted messages. Can you find a way to decrypt the others? The flag consists entirely of uppercase characters and has the form HTB{SOMETHINGHERE}. You still have to add the {} yourself. |

| Description | While following the breadcrumbs from the secret messages you managed to recover from Broider, Bonnie gathered more information from his well trusted “Tsirakia” and found out that the messages were about the destinations of a STS (Space Transportation Ship). The STS, named “Paketo”, is a notoriously large spaceship that transports military supplies for the Golden Fang mercenary army. After spending some time observing the seemingly random trajectory of Paketo, you and Paulie manually plotted the delivery locations and realized that the STS’s orbit forms an elliptic curve. Your spaceship’s advanced technology GPS has calculated the exact parameters of the curve. Can you somehow predict Paketo’s final destination and hijack it? |

| Description | After figuring out the destination of Paketo, Ulysses devised a hijacking plan to sabotage the delivery of the military equipment. Despite efforts, the plan did not work as expected and a battle ensued. Since your movement was restricted, Miyuki ordered you to hide behind a huge container with unknown contents in fear of taking more damage. Seeing all the killings of the manipulated cyborgs (code named: Marher) brought back memories of your time on the graveyard planet. Suddenly, a cyborg appeared in front of you. Unable to move from the shock, death was all you could think about. Fortunately, Ulysses manages to save you at the last second by knocking the cyborg unconscious. You bring it back to the laboratory to use some of its functionalities to repair parts of your brain. You discover that all of its components are encrypted. Can you find a way to extract the secret key? |

Night after night, you frantically tried to repair the encrypted parts of your brain, reversing custom protocols implemented by your father, wanting to pinpoint exactly what damage had been done and constantly keeping notes because of your inability of forming new memories. On one of those nights, you had a flashback. Your father had always talked about a new technology and how it would change the galaxy. You realized that he had used it on you. This technology dealt with a proof of a work function and decentralized networks. Along with Virgil’s help, you had a “Eureka!” moment, but his approach, brute forcing, meant draining all your energy. Can you find a quicker way to validate new memory blocks? |

| Difficulty | medium |
| Description | Miyuki, wanting to find out more evidence about Draeger and his escape, planned a space trip to the maximum security black hole where Draeger was held captive. Problems though soon arose as the approach to the black hole caused distortions on your electronics. Memories of the traumatic experience you had when the Council guards brutally ripped you from your father’s hands painfully flooded your mind. The one thing you never forgot was the signal he sent you while you were still within range of the planet. Only two packets got through, but since they were encrypted you couldn’t figure out what they were. Now, being more determined than ever to find your father, having gained experience during the missions with the squad, you know that it’s time to decrypt the signal. |

### Mind In The Clouds

| Difficulty | hard |
| Description | Mysterious kidnappings of Longhir’s best scientists began to occur ever since Draeger gained influence in the council, a fact known to everyone in the troupe. Virgil was certain that these kidnappings had something to do with Meiro and the neuro-linked technology he helped develop. He also knew that Draeger wanted to experiment by uploading minds to the cloud and then connecting them to androids. These thoughts ran through Miyuki’s mind while she was searching for clues in the prison. After finding no signs that indicated a physical escape, she concluded that Draeger hadn’t actually escaped. Instead, he had somehow initiated a backup version of his mind, which he had downloaded into an unknown body. Upon hearing Miyuki’s conclusions, the team was in a rather charged mood. As you sit in the corner, almost paralyzed by the crippling news, you can only think of one thing: Is your father in the cloud/s too? |

| Description | Reading out loud Danbeer’s thoughts from the cloud server shocked everyone. Knowing that your father has become a consciousness that can be easily turned off and on is traumatizing. You are overwhelmed by your feelings and angry at yourself. You begin to ask yourself. Why am I feeling so much pain? Is there a part of my brain that is still encrypted? Have I screwed up again? You run towards the lab while shouting and slamming the doors behind you. Upon seeing that, Ulysses immediately flees the spaceship. Many days have passed and you are still obsessed with finding the part of your brain that needs to be repaired. Your comrades are startled by your sudden introversion and worry about Ulysses, who is nowhere to be seen. Weeks have passed and Ulysses is still missing. Suddenly, the ship receives a docking signal and as you scan the alien spacecraft for signs of life, a male passenger is discovered. It’s Ulysses! Excited, he rushes out of his capsule and overtakes the crew members, that longed to hug him to get to your lab. Ulysses informs you that he has managed to steal one of the cloud backup servers from the facility where the experiments took place. It seems that this device alters the consciousness of each test subject. Stunned by this information, a realization comes to mind. You are going to get your father back. |

Thus, there are now fears that the intergalactic war will also affect this neutral planet. If Draeger and his mercenaries manage to maintain unauthorised access in Urkir's space station and escalate their privileges, they will soon be able to activate the station's defence mechanisms that are able to prevent any spaceship from entering Urkir's airspace.

This division's goal is to target any critical infrastructure and cause financial losses to their opponents. They never restore the encrypted files, even if the victim pays the ransom. This case is the number one priority for the team at the moment. Miyuki has seized the hard-drive of one of the members and it is believed that inside of which there may be credentials for the Ransomware's Dashboard. Given the AppData folder, can you retrieve the wanted credentials? Download: http://134.209.177.115/forensics/forensics_seized.zip |

| Difficulty | hard |
| Description | Miyuki has come across what seems to be a suspicious process running on one of her spaceship's navigation systems. After investigating the origin of this process, it seems to have been initiated by a script called "SatelliteGuidance.vbs". Eventually, one of your engineers informs her that she found this file in the spaceship's Intergalactic Inbox and thought it was an interactive guide for the ship's satellite operations. She tried to run the file but nothing happened. You and Miyuki start analysing it and notice you don't understand its code... it is obfuscated! What could it be and who could be behind its creation? Use your skills to uncover the truth behind the obfuscation layers. |

| Difficulty | hard |
| Description | You and Miyuki have succeeded in dis-empowering Draeger's army in every possible way. Stopped their fuel-supply plan, arrested their ransomware gang, prevented massive phishing campaigns and understood their tactics and techniques in depth. Now it is the time for the final blow. The final preparations are completed. Everyone is in their stations waiting for the signal. This mission can only be successful if you use the element of surprise. Thus, the signal must remain a secret until the end of the operation. During some last-minute checks you notice some weird behaviour in Miyuki's PC. You must find out if someone managed to gain access to her PC before it's too late. If so, the signal must change. Time is limited and there is no room for errors.

| Description | Ramona's obsession with modifications and the addition of artifacts to her body has slowed her down and made her fail and almost get killed in many missions. For this reason, she decided to hack a tiny robot under Golden Fang's ownership called "Compressor", which can reduce and increase the volume of any object to minimize/maximize it according to the needs of the mission. With this item, she will be able to carry any spare part she needs without adding extra weight to her back, making her fast. Can you help her take it and hack it? |

| Description | The possibility of a weapon that alters the very core of the structure of the universe itself is beyond even the wildest imaginations. Or is it? Ramona and Paulie are exeperimenting with concentric Dyson spheres to achieve the impossible, to harvest the energy of an entire quasar in order to create such a weapon. The exepriments showed that five spheres are the optimal solution. Alas, the thermal equilibrium is still a pressing issue they need to figure out. They measure the temperature of each sphere for every minute. Now all that is left is to properly analyze the data and figure out why there are so many thermal inconsistencies |

### Fuel Crisis

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | After travelling for too many light years, we managed to reach an uninhabited planet to rest for a while. We got a problem though. Phalcon is running out of fuel and we need to stop at the nearest space station to refuel. The closest one is the B1-4S3D station, where we are unfortunately banned from docking our ship. Our surveillance showed that the station uses two OCR cameras to read the unique ID of each spaceship entering. The first one is used as a validator for the second one. We've managed to find a way to disable the validation process for a split second while our ship passes, but we still need to pass through the second camera. Furthermore, our lead hacker opened a connection with the second camera, which we can use to upload our custom model weights. Try to find a way to change the predictions of the model when we pass through the second gate. Be careful though, the other four spaceships that are in front of us need to be ID'd correctly so no suspicion raises. |

| Description | The spaceship cruiser has been hit! Ramona must hurry and check if the central system is intact! The enemy must have used electromagnetic wave canons! <br> The spaceship's sensors are going crazy and the autopilot system broke down! There is no chance to turn back the enemy will be waiting... But there is a meteor shower ahead! <br> In order to get through safely, the spaceship's power and consumption need to be balanced. Both the laser canons and the thrusters are vital parts for this... And she has to control them manually! <br> Quickly! Ramona needs to upload a valid configuration file to overwrite the values of all sensors on board. The onboard neural network will verify that the new configuration leads to the required power distribution. <br> Attention! The values of the sensors must be at least 99.99% accurate for this to work! Hurry now, time is running out! |

### Quantum Engine

| Difficulty | medium |
| Description | We need to travel to one of Draeger's lair in a galaxy far away from here, to search for any clues that might help us prove how Draeger manipulated her to be his most trustworthy cold-blooded assassin. However, traveling there can be quite difficult since it's flooded with the most state-of-the-art IFGs attack spacecrafts. Should we be able to outspeed them, we might have a chance of making it there in one piece. That is why we came to you. Word on the solar system is that you are one of the best quantum mechanics of the galaxy, which I find odd considering your age. Will you be able to modify Phalcon's acceleration system so no IFG spacecraft can ever catch us? |

| Description | After the successful mission of Space Pirate, Bonnie ordered Ramona to hijack another spaceship on her own on a stealth mission. She managed to get inside it and had limited access to the central controller.  By reverse-engineering the controller, we figured out that it uses a unique set of VM instructions with limited capabilities. Can you help her break out of this VM and gain unlimited access? |

| Description | One of our enhanced radio telescopes captured some weird fluctuations from a nearby star. It was idle for decades due to the fact that it was fully enclosed by a Dyson Sphere but its patterns began to change drastically leading us to believe that someone is controlling part of the megastructure to release energy and send these pulses directed to us in order to transmit a message. They must have known that our equipment can read even the slightest fluctuations. |

| Description | After Ramona helped Virgil escape from the prison they were holding him they had to find a way to flee the planet but all the spaceships were grounded. Luckily they manage to gain access to a hangar with decommissioned escape pods. After some tinkering with the pod's control panel, they managed to attach some probes to it and reverse engineer the proprietary protection circuit but some of it appears to be damaged. The only thing holding them back was finding a way to gain access to the flight control system. |

### Into the Matrix

#### Stats

| Difficulty | medium |
| Description | After a long time away it is finally time to get back all the equipment build all those years. While going through the hardware devices to reconfigure or upgrade them one of them seemed a bit off. It appears that someone was toying with a few of the devices, changing and breaking the hard-wired components which resulted in some of them malfunctioning. The status matrix in one of the armor-enhancing weapons seems to display random indications making the weapon selection system unusable. This, combined with the fact that most of the circuitry is now under a hard epoxy resin makes it impossible to reconfigure the hardware connection, thus the only solution is to reverse engineer the current device layout and add an additional circuitry that will work around the current one.  |
