| Description | We've tracked connections made from an infected workstation back to this server. We believe it is running a C2 checkin interface, the source code of which we aquired from a temporarily exposed Git repository several months ago. Apparently the engineers behind it are obsessed with speed, extending their programs with low-level code. We think in their search for speed they might have cut some corners - can you find a way in? |

| Description | While running routine updates, our deployment service alerted us of a hash mismatch on an FTP server installed in our network perimeter. While investigating, our SOC team notified us of breach attempts inside the network. We believe a threat actor has compromised the version control system and has inserted a backdoor to try and pivot throughout the network. We got locked from logging into the server, leaving only the FTP exposed. Can you find a way back inside before the attacker owns the network? |

### Midenios

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | hard |
| Description | We've identified an XSS vulnerability on a new RaaS product advertised in Felonious Forums. As we suspected, MonkeyBusiness operatives use Tor Browser to communicate with potential customers, and the exfiltrated IPs are proven ineffective. After a sting operation, we've managed to push some malicious commits in the tor browser repository. While not as notorious as V8, Tor Browser's JS engine is less hardened than its competitor, and bugs as simple as relative ArrayBuffer OOBs can be catastrophic. Can you find a way to gain RCE and identify the threat actors? |

## Crypto

### ElElGamal

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | After some minor warnings from IDS, you decide to check the logs to see if anything suspicious is happening. Surprised by what you see, you realise that one of your honeypots has been compromised with a cryptominer. As you look at the processes, you discover a backdoor attached to one of them. The backdoor retrieves the private key from the /key route of a C2. It establishes a session by sending an encrypted initilazation sequence. After the session is established, it waits for commands. The commands are encrypted and executed by the source code you found. Unfortunately, the IDS could not detect the request to /key and the machine was rebooted after the compromise, so the key cannot be found on the stack. Can you find out if any data was exfiltrated from the honeypot to mitigate future attacks? |

| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | We have received reports from CloudCompany that resources are involved in malicious activity similar to attempting unauthorized access to remote hosts on the Internet. We have since shut down the server and locked the SA. While we were trying to investigate what the entry point was, we discovered a phishing email from CloudCompany's IT department. You've since notified the vendor, and they've provided the source code of the email signing server for a security assessment. We've identified an outdated RSA verification code implementation, which we believe could be the cause of why the threat actors were able to impersonate the vendor. Can you replicate the attack and notify them of any possible misuse? |

### Homomurphy's Law

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | medium |
| Description | After a sophisticated ransomware attack, the operational integrity of the country's critical maritime infrastructure has suffered a severe disruption, resulting in a force majeure declaration at several key container terminals. The Department of Public Enterprises has asked for our help to restore the shipping infrastructure's functionality. During the investigation, we uncovered a complex rootkit that, among other things, hides IPv4/IPv6 packets, the kernel module location, and the process itself. Subsequently, we cannot recover the C2 communication from the network capture taken during the incident. The ransomware note specified a payment portal. During the web application security assessment, an open directory on /backups was found, and two files were recovered. They appear to be part of a benchmarking utility for various encryption libraries used during the ransomware's development, and the TCP service is still up. Despite our warnings, officials decided to pay the ransom and haven't heard anything since, which confirms our suspicions that this originated as a wiper attack. We now have two days before the wiper deletes everything. We believe the encryption keys of the benchmarking service are the same as those used for the malware's encryption routine. Are you going to be able to prevent an economic meltdown and recover the encrypted files?  |

### 400Curves

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | medium |
| Description | After the takeover of Felonious Forums, we've managed to identify and apprehend a low-level MonkeyBusiness APT operative. The developer was in charge of reselling components of the Zoid malware family. During a forensics investigation of the operative's computer, we obtained the prototype source code of the TLS-based proxy service, which was used to obfuscate C2 traffic between the compromised machines to evade interception/detection. The remote host is still up, but the ssh keys we found have since been invalidated. During an assessment of the component's source code, it looks like the key for the TLS-encrypted traffic is generated using the ECDH protocol with the P-256 curve, which is the most common curve on the Internet. Can you find a way to retrieve the proxy service's private key? |

| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | During a recent security assessment of a well-known consulting company, the competent team found some employees' credentials in publicly available breach databases. Thus, they called us to trace down the actions performed by these users. During the investigation, it turned out that one of them had been compromised. Although their security engineers took the necessary steps to remediate and secure the user and the internal infrastructure, the user was getting compromised repeatedly. Narrowing down our investigation to find possible persistence mechanisms, we are confident that the malicious actors use WMI to establish persistence. You are given the WMI repository of the user's workstation. Can you analyze and expose their technique? |

| Description | A CEO of a startup company reported that he could no longer access his Password Vault. It seems the password has been changed, but he states not to have done so. He reports receiving a birthday invitation to a Paintball party the last week. A few days later, his Italian friend told him that her email had been hacked and never sent out those birthday invites. He fears his lost password might have something to do with that birthday invite. Their SOC team confirmed their assumptions by admitting that this document escaped their attention and did not trigger any alert. Now they want us, ENIGMA, to analyze the provided network capture they took on the day and the document sent via his friends' email. |
