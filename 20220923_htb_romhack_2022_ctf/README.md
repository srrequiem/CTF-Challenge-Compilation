### BBGun16

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | medium |
| Description | After the BBGun06 incident, where a phishing email was discovered, the outdated RSA verification code implementation was fixed. This was the reason why the threat actors were able to impersonate the vendor, CloudCompany. Unfortunately, after a forensic investigation, it was discovered that sensitive data was exfiltrated from an internal file storage server where a similar verification process was used. Can you replicate the attack and inform the company about possible misuse? |

### Whac-A-Mole

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | hard |
| Description | It was the year 2700 when the first space beaver appeared. Life on planet Earth was not the same after that. No one was safe anymore. Beavers began appearing in seemingly random places and scaring people. It took 12 years for the first research paper on these mysterious creatures to be published. It was a revolutionary study that proved their appearance was not random. The researchers managed to simulate their movements and create a bug bounty game called Whac-A-mole, hoping that someone would figure out how to crack it. As an avid retro gamer, you think you have a unique insight into this game. Are you ready for this challenge? |
