| Description | ![logo_turbotactical_2_256_textured](files/logo_turbotactical_2_256_textured.png) <br> We need your help! DEADFACE has been wreaking havoc on several companies and individuals. Many of us have joined together to form Turbo Tactical, an organization of cybersecurity and infosec professionals and enthusiasts to help out DEADFACE's victims. <br> While performing some basic reconnaissance, we found a public Discourse forum called Ghost Town that DEADFACE uses to communicate with each other. We managed to get an insider to open the forum up to non-authenticated users. Use Ghost Town as a resource to find out what DEADFACE is up to and how they managed to execute their attacks. <br> [Ghost Town](https://ghosttown.deadface.io) <br> There is a post titled "Another year of mayhem". Submit the flag as the username of the user that started the post and the date the post was made in this format: `flag{username_MMDD}`. <br> Example: `flag{hackyboi_0615} |
