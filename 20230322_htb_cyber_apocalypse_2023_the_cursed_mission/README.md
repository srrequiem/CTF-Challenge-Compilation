| Difficulty | insane |
| Description | Having now the relic, Pandora is trying to create a plan to shut down the vessels. Unfortunately for her, the alien's intel is one step ahead, as they somehow know what she is up to. An incident response operation started as Pandora was sure the aliens had gained access to her teammate's host. Although many compromised hosts were found, only one sample is applicable for further analysis. If you neutralize this threat by analyzing the sample, Pandora will be able to proceed with her plan. |

| Description | As your investigation progressed, a clue led you to a local bar where you met an undercover agent with valuable information. He spoke of a famous astronomy scientist who lived in the area and extensively studied the relic. The scientist wrote a book containing valuable insights on the relic's location, but encrypted it before he disappeared to keep it safe from malicious intent. The old man disclosed that the book was hidden in the scientist's house and revealed two phrases that the scientist rambled about before vanishing. |

### Inside The Matrix

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | As you deciphered the Matrix, you discovered that the astronomy scientist had observed that certain stars were not real. He had created two 5x5 matrices with values based on the time the stars were bright, but after some time, the stars stopped emitting light. Nonetheless, he had managed to capture every matrix until then and created an algorithm that simulated their generation. However, he could not understand what was hidden behind them as he was missing something. He believed that if he could understand the stars, he would be able to locate the secret tombs where the relic was hidden. |

### Converging Visions

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | hard |
| Description | As you hold the relic in your hands, it prompts you to input a coordinate. The ancient scriptures you uncovered near the pharaoh's tomb reveal that the artifact is capable of transmitting the locations of vessels. The initial coordinate must be within proximity of the vessels, and an algorithm will then calculate their precise locations for transmission. However, you soon discover that the coordinates transmitted are not correct, and are encrypted using advanced alien techniques to prevent unauthorized access. It becomes clear that the true coordinates are hidden, serving only to authenticate those with knowledge of the artifact's secrets. Can you decipher this alien encryption and uncover the genuine coordinates to locate the vessels and destroy them? |
