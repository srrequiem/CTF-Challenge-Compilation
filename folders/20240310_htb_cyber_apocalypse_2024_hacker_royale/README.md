### Flash-ing Logs

#### Stats

| Attribute | Info |
|---|---|
| Difficulty | hard |
| Description | After deactivating the lasers, you approach the door to the server room. It seems there's a secondary flash memory inside, storing the log data of every entry. As the system is air-gapped, you must modify the logs directly on the chip to avoid detection. Be careful to alter only the user_id = 0x5244 so the registered logs point out to a different user. The rest of the logs stored in the memory must remain as is. |
