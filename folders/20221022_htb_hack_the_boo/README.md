### Trick or Breach

#### Stats

| Difficulty | easy |
| Description | Our company has been working on a secret project for almost a year. None knows about the subject, although rumor is that it is about an old Halloween legend where an old witch in the woods invented a potion to bring pumpkins to life, but in a more up-to-date approach. Unfortunately, we learned that malicious actors accessed our network in a massive cyber attack. Our security team found that the hack had occurred when a group of children came into the office's security external room for trick or treat. One of the children was found to be a paid actor and managed to insert a USB into one of the security personnel's computers, which allowed the hackers to gain access to the company's systems. We only have a network capture during the time of the incident. Can you find out if they stole the secret project? |

| Description | In my company, we are developing a new python game for Halloween. I'm the leader of this project; thus, I want it to be unique. So I researched the most cutting-edge python libraries for game development until I stumbled upon a private game-dev discord server. One member suggested I try a new python library that provides enhanced game development capabilities. I was excited about it until I tried it. Quite simply, all my files are encrypted now. Thankfully I manage to capture the memory and the network traffic of my Linux server during the incident. Can you analyze it and help me recover my files? To get the flag, connect to the docker service and answer the questions.<br/><span class="color-red">WARNING! Do not try to run the malware on your host.
